This project demonstrates 3 layer architechture. It's a simple toy store application. This administration portion is coded in c# winform. User can search and do typical CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functions on customer, and product modules. Manager can run report on product and customer as well.
The main purpose of this project is to put various code snippets into a collection of codes. Hopefully, they are very useful to beginning level c# programmers(and intermediate level as well). I tried to put as much validations on the codes as necessary. So please don't be too picky. Here's the list of some features:

	Value Object
- Generic/common class was made to carry error messages.
- Separating each module such as Customer, Product into its own class and its own file for the ease of code management.
- Creating the ADO.NET Entity Data Model using Enity Framework. 
- Utilizing properties (get/set accessor) to represent columns of the table. 
	Data Access Object
- Putting together connection string for SQL Server database in app.config file.
- Utilizing SQLcommand, SQLDataAdapter, and SQLConnection class (ADO.NET).
- Extracting readable error messages from exception stacktrace.
- Writing characters (error messages) to a stream and output to a file.
- Technique of putting parameters together to form where clause for select statement.
	Business Object
- Manipulating DataSet, DataTable, and DataRow (ADO.NET)
- Differentiate between business logic errors and data accessing errors. Catch and send them appropriate places.
- Technique of bubbling error messages from data access layer up to business layer, and to presentation layer.
	Visual Studio IDE
- Breaking whole winform solution into several projects So it would be easier for each team member to work on different module.
- Managing multiple panels on a winform menu.
- Binding DataTable to DataGridView and display only selected columns.
- Utilizing OpenFileDialog class.
- Loading pictureBox with an image selected from a result of OpenFileDialog.
- Converting image to byte array using FileStream class.
- Creating Crystal report, setting display columns, header, details, and footer.
- Programmatically call the report and display it in winForm using CrystalReportViewer.

Todo:
1. Why top level menu didn't show shortcut (ex. &Product)
2. Pagination on grid
3. Display an image based on selected value in a gridview.?
